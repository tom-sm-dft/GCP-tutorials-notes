# GCP deploy python application

## Objectives
* Create a project - Projects bundle code, virtual machines and other resources together for easier development and monitoring.
* Build and run your 'Hello World!' app - how to run app using Cloud shell directly in browser. Then deploy app to the web using gcloud command.
* After will be able to experiment with it.

## Project set-up
GCP organises resources into projects, which collect all of the related resources for a single application in one place.
Begin by creating a new project or selecting an existing project for this tutorial.

## Using cloud shell
Shell is a built-in command-line tool for the console. We're going to use Cloud Shell to deploy our app.
To activate click >_ button in the top right.
### Clone the sample code
Use Cloud Shell to clone and navigate to the 'Hello World' code. The sample code is cloned from your project repository to the Cloud Shell.
Note: If the directory already exists, remove the previous files before cloning.
In Cloud Shell, enter the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
```
Then switch to the tutorial directory:
```bash
cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python37/hello_world
```

## Configuring your deployment
### Exploring the application
Files that configure the application
```bash
ls
>>> app.yaml  main.py  main_test.py  requirements.txt
cat main.py
```
```python
# If `entrypoint` is not defined in app.yaml, App Engine will look for an app
# called `app` in `main.py`.
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def hello():
    """Return a friendly HTTP greeting."""
    return 'Hello World!'
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # This is used when running locally only. When deploying to Google App
    # Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app. This
    # can be configured by adding an `entrypoint` to app.yaml.
    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080, debug=True)
# [END gae_python37_app]
```
The application is a simple Python application that uses the Flask web framework. This Python app responds to a request with an HTTP header and the message Hello World!.
### Exploring the configuration
App Engine uses YAML files to specify a deployment's configuration. app.yaml files contain information about your application, like the runtime environment, environment variables and more.
This file contains the minimal amount of configuration required for a Python 3 application. The runtime field specifies the python37 run-time environment.
```bash
cat app.yaml
```
```yaml
runtime: python37
```
